A project to create an AI framework in python using only Numpy. 

Features:
* linear layers
* Batch Normalization
* ReLU, LeakyReLU, and Softmax activations
* SGD and ADAM optimizers

Demo: 

Demonstrated the framework by building and training an MNIST digit classifier with only my Numpy framework. 
PyTorch was not used. Torch Vision was only used to access the MNIST images easily.
