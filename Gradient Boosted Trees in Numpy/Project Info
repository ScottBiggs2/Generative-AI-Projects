A project to create a gradient boosted decision tree framework in python using only Numpy. 

Features:
* classical gradient boosted trees for classification and regression tasks from only numpy
* additional optimizations with histogram splitting, BFS, and vectorized tree traversal.

Demo: 

Comparisons on regression (california housing) and classification (breast cancer) against XGBoost,
LGBM, and Scikit-Learn packaged models.
