A project to demonstrate RAG (retreival-augmented generation), supervised fine tuning, prompt engineering, and concept erasure techniques. 

Idea: A detective (played by TinyLLaMA from Huggingface) arrives at the office 
to find his desk covered in documentation about a case he can't remember. The detective has in fact witnessed the crime, 
but cannot recall what he saw or other common crime fighting facts. 
It is the users job to interact with the detective to help him remember and ultimately solve the case. 

Features:
* TinyLLaMA
* Huggingface transformers, tokenizers, etc
* RAG with chroma vector database of detective documents
* Supervised fine-tuning to give the detective a classic film-noir vibe
* Concept erasure from local TinyLLaMA model
* Prompt engineering to reinfoce above effects
