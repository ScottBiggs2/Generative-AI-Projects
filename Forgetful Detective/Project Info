A project to demonstrate RAG (retreival-augmented generation), supervised fine tuning, prompt engineering, and concept erasure techniques in an LLM. 

Idea: 
A detective (played by TinyLLaMA from Huggingface or LLaMA 3.2 1B in the final version) and the player collaborate to solve a murder mystery in the English countryside, 
in the style of Agatha Christies Hercule Poirot mysteries. The model will be fine tuned to have an amiable personality and be familiar with the cast and setting.
The clues will be gradually discovered by the player as they chat with the detective (model) and stored as documents for RAG. 
The twist is that the model is edited to forget the key character (perpetrator), so the player will need to solve the case on their own to win. 
Bonus points if they can convince/explain/remind the model so it can solve the crime as well. 

Features:
* TinyLLaMA, LLaMA 3.2 1B
* Huggingface transformers, tokenizers, etc
* RAG with chroma vector database of detective documents
* Supervised fine-tuning to give the detective an Agatha Christie
* Concept erasure with CAV and ROME
* Prompt engineering to reinfoce above effects
* Streamlit app UI
