My submission to the Kaggle competition 'I'm something of a painter myself' (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/gan-getting-started ). Building and training a GAN network architecture using PyTorch to translate photos into digital paintings in the style of Monet.

I referenced Ankur Shukla's CycleGAN submission (https://www.kaggle.com/code/ankurkumarshukla/cyclegan-from-scratch) as well as a DCGAN tutorial from the PyTorch documentation (https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/dcgan_faces_tutorial.html) for guidance.
